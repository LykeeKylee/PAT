# PAT Test Practice

## Nead to learn
* Large integer operation

## Paces
* Basic Level: 95/95
* Advanced Level: 12/155

## Classifications of problems 
* String: 1001, 1005
* Simulation: 1002, 1006, 1008, 1009, 1011
* Dijkstra: 1003
* DFS&BFS: 1004
* Dynamic Programming: 1007
* Partition: 1007
* Binary Search: 1010
* About Grades: 1012

## Some notes
* Use fill() to initialize arrays.
* Use #include<bits/stdc++.h> to reduce codes.
* Main codes about DFS&BFS can be seen in problem 1004.
* Use minmax_element, min_element, max_element, minmax, min, max to find the minimum and maximum element
* Use isdigit(x) to judge whether x is a number or not.
* Note that numbers may be out of the range of int and long long. Avoid to use unsigned types.It's useless.(1010)
* Nomally the rank is like 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 6.(1012)
