* Priority Queue or Queue: 1014, 1017, 1026
* Prime Number: 1015, 1152
* Radix: 1010, 1015, 1019

## Some notes
* THE MOST IMPORTANT 
* IS TO 
* READ QUESTIONS CAREFULLY.
* 
* Use fill() to initialize arrays.
* Use #include<bits/stdc++.h> to reduce codes.
* Main codes about DFS&BFS can be seen in problem 1004.
* Use minmax_element, min_element, max_element, minmax, min, max to find the minimum and maximum element
* Use isdigit(x) to judge whether x is a number or not.
* Note that numbers may be out of the range of int and long long. Avoid to use unsigned types.It's useless.(1010)
* Nomally the rank is like 1, 1, 3, 4, 4, 6.(1012)
